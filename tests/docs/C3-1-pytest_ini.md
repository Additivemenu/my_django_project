Let me break down your working pytest.ini configuration:

```ini
[pytest]
# This tells pytest which Django settings module to use for the tests
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = tests.settings

# This adds the --ds (Django Settings) option to every pytest command automatically
addopts = --ds=tests.settings

# Defines which files pytest should recognize as test files
python_files = tests.py test_*.py *_tests.py
```

Let's examine each part:

1. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = tests.settings`
   - This is the standard Django setting that tells Django which settings module to use
   - In your case, it points to `settings.py` in your `tests` directory

2. `addopts = --ds=tests.settings`
   - `addopts` allows you to specify command line options that will be automatically added every time you run pytest
   - `--ds` is a pytest-django specific option that stands for "Django Settings"
   - Having both this and `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` provides redundancy - if one method fails, the other serves as a backup
   - This is particularly helpful because sometimes the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable might not be properly set in all environments

3. `python_files = tests.py test_*.py *_tests.py`
   - This tells pytest which files it should consider as test files
   - It will look for:
     - Files named exactly `tests.py`
     - Files that start with `test_` and end with `.py`
     - Files that end with `_tests.py`

The configuration works because:
- It ensures Django knows where to find your test settings (through two different methods)
- The test settings file is in a location pytest can find (in your `tests` directory)
- It clearly defines which files should be treated as test files

This is more robust than just using `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` alone because the `--ds` option helps ensure the settings are properly loaded even in environments where environment variables might not be correctly set.
