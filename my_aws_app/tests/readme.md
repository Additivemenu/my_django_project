very worth learning how to write unit test especially where external service is involved. 

you need to mock the external dependency smartly

# fixtures

I'll break down each fixture in detail to help you understand how they work and what they're used for.

1. **The `mock_s3_client` Fixture**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_s3_client():
    with patch('boto3.client') as mock_client:
        s3_instance = MagicMock()
        mock_client.return_value = s3_instance
        yield s3_instance
```

Let's break this down:
- `@pytest.fixture` marks this as a pytest fixture - a function that provides test setup and/or cleanup
- `patch('boto3.client')` creates a mock replacement for the boto3.client function
- `MagicMock()` creates a mock object that can track how it's called and provide predetermined responses
- `mock_client.return_value = s3_instance` makes the boto3.client() call return our mock S3 instance
- `yield s3_instance` provides the mock to the test function
- The `with` context manager ensures cleanup after the test

Usage example:
```python
def test_something(mock_s3_client):  # fixture automatically injected
    # mock_s3_client is the s3_instance from the fixture
    mock_s3_client.upload_file.return_value = None  # configure mock behavior
    mock_s3_client.upload_file.assert_called_once()  # verify mock was called
```

2. **The `test_image_setup` Fixture**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_image_setup(tmp_path):  # tmp_path is a built-in pytest fixture
    # Create a test uploads directory
    uploads_dir = tmp_path / "uploads"
    uploads_dir.mkdir()

    # Create a test PNG file
    test_file = uploads_dir / "test.png"
    test_file.write_bytes(b"fake png content")

    # Temporarily override BASE_DIR setting
    original_base_dir = settings.BASE_DIR
    settings.BASE_DIR = str(tmp_path)
    
    yield str(test_file)
    
    # Cleanup
    settings.BASE_DIR = original_base_dir
```

Let's break this down:
- `tmp_path` is a built-in pytest fixture that provides a temporary directory unique to each test function
- The fixture creates this directory structure:
  ```
  tmp_path/
  └── uploads/
      └── test.png
  ```
- It temporarily changes Django's `BASE_DIR` setting to point to this test directory
- After the test, it restores the original `BASE_DIR`

Usage example:
```python
def test_upload(test_image_setup):  # fixture automatically injected
    test_file_path = test_image_setup  # this is the str(test_file) that was yielded
    # test_file_path points to the temporary PNG file
```

Here's a complete example showing how these fixtures work together:
```python
def test_successful_upload(mock_s3_client, test_image_setup):
    client = Client()
    
    # The test_image_setup fixture has already:
    # 1. Created a temporary directory
    # 2. Created an uploads subdirectory
    # 3. Created a test.png file
    # 4. Modified Django's BASE_DIR to point to our temp directory
    
    # The mock_s3_client fixture has already:
    # 1. Created a mock S3 client
    # 2. Replaced boto3.client with our mock
    
    # Configure mock behavior
    mock_s3_client.upload_file.return_value = None
    
    # Make request
    response = client.post('/api/aws-app/upload/test.png/')
    
    # Verify everything worked
    assert response.status_code == 200
    mock_s3_client.upload_file.assert_called_once()
    
    # After the test:
    # 1. test_image_setup will restore the original BASE_DIR
    # 2. pytest will clean up the temporary directory
    # 3. mock_s3_client will stop mocking boto3.client
```

Key Testing Concepts to Remember:
1. **Fixtures are Reusable**: You can use the same fixture in multiple tests
```python
def test_one(mock_s3_client): ...
def test_two(mock_s3_client): ...
```

2. **Fixtures Can Use Other Fixtures**: Like how `test_image_setup` uses `tmp_path`
```python
@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture(another_fixture):
    # use another_fixture here
```

3. **Cleanup with yield**: Everything after `yield` runs after the test
```python
@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture():
    # setup
    yield something
    # cleanup
```

4. **Mocking is for External Services**: We mock S3 because:
   - We don't want to make real AWS calls in tests
   - Tests should be fast and not depend on external services
   - We can control the mock's behavior for testing different scenarios

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts further?
